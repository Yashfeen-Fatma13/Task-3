Dashboard Analysis

Explanation : Step by step how i generated my Dashboard

As part of my assigned task to create an interactive business dashboard using Power BI, I have completed the following steps:


---

1. Selected and Displayed Key KPIs

I started by identifying the most important performance indicators for the business. I included the following KPIs in the form of cards at the top of the dashboard:

Total Revenue

Average Revenue

Total Transactions


These KPIs provide a quick snapshot of overall performance for stakeholders.

2. Added Interactive Slicers

To make the dashboard interactive and user-friendly, I added multiple slicers:

Year

Quarter

Rank

Store


These slicers allow users to filter all visuals on the page based on their selected criteria, making it easier to focus on specific time periods or categories.

3. Created Insightful Visualizations

I used various visual elements to represent the data clearly:

A clustered bar chart to show Revenue by Region

A stacked column chart for Revenue by Quarter

A donut chart to visualize Revenue by Store

A bar chart for Revenue by Rank

A combo chart (line + bar) for Revenue by Month to show time-based trends


These visuals help in analyzing performance across regions, time periods, and categories.

4. Maintained Visual Consistency

I used a consistent color theme (mainly blue and aqua tones) to keep the visuals visually appealing and professional. I also aligned all the elements properly for a clean layout.

5. Included a Sales Reps Report

To give detailed insight at the individual level, I added a table displaying Sales Reps and their performance metrics. This helps in understanding how each rep is contributing to the business.
